## <img src="../img/about_me.png" height="50px"> 
I am currently working with Assistant Professor Annamaria Mesaros, group leader of the [Machine Listening Group](https://research.tuni.fi/machinelistening/) at Tampere university.

My research interests include audio signal processing, machine learning, acoustic scene classification and sound event detection.

## <img src="../img/career.png" height="50px"> My career
For a brief and compact overview, take a look at my 2-page [CV](../documents/Martin_CV.pdf).
I have been working as a postdoctoral research fellow at the [Machine Listening Group](https://research.tuni.fi/machinelistening/),
at [Tampere University](https://www.tuni.fi/en) since 2020. Between 2019 and 2020 I was a Postdoc in the [Image and Signal Processing group](https://isp.uv.es/).
I received my PhD in 2019 from the [Universitat de Val√®ncia](https://www.uv.es/), where I worked in the 
[signal processing and acoustic technology group](https://spat.blogs.uv.es/). 
I have worked on acoustic signal processing, more specifically in the field of sound event recognition, the topic of my PhD thesis.

I have diverse research interests and am always happy to dive into a new area.
